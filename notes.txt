
possible operations:

    - write:
        - sends command of 1+ bytes
        - doesn't care about read bytes

    - read:
        - may send? / sends request of 1+ bytes
        - reads 1+ bytes
        - may have non-deterministic end?
            - continues to send payload byte(s looped?) whilst not finished reading

    - functional:
        - wait: sends / reads nothing, but awaits for some time
        - finish: stops queue when everything is fully awaited
